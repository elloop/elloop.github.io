Data for my blog.
====
Data in this repository is automatically transformed by Jekyll into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub. I also test the data locally in my computer using Jekyll.

layout is forked from:
https://github.com/flannelJesus/flannelJesus.github.io

Then, I customize the theme using [Solar Theme](http://mattvh.github.io/solar-theme-jekyll/) (Solarized theme).

Also, I changed the code highlight to Solarized-Dark theme, using [pygments-style-solarized](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pygments-style-solarized/0.1.1)
