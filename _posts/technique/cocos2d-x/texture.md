##questions
- make animation with cocosbuilder. 
    - frame animation use texture packer?
    - spine animation use cocosbuilder?
- when to clear texturecache and spriteframechache.



##concept
*Texture* is the basic element in cocos, because cocos use opengl to render gfx, and opengl use the texture, you can treat texture as pictures.

*format*
- according to platform, different formats are supported. such as png, jpeg, ...

*max texture size*
- if you want to cross-platform 1024\*1024 is the max. some platform may allow 2048\*2048.

*sprite sheet*
- way: generated by tools like Texture Packer. pvr.czz.
- advantange: quick, save memory 25%. 

*load texture in cocos*
- in cocos2.x: load many texture can be very slow.
- in cocos3.x: improved.

*TextureCache* and *SpriteFrame*
- pros: load once, use anywhere.

*frame animation*
- use sprite frame, manual add.
- use sprite sheet
- use ccb

*spine animation*

*load texture asynchronize*
- use load screen to hide the loading process.
